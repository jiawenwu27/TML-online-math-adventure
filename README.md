This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
## 🎯 Highlights

- **Experimentally structured**: Supports formal math, word problems, and interactive games with counterbalanced delivery.  
- **Choice manipulation**: Users select activity types, offering research‑driven autonomy dynamics.  
- **PWA & responsive**: Downloadable, works offline, and optimized for multiple devices.  
- **Full-stack architecture**: Frontend powered by Next.js; backend powered by AWS Amplify and DynamoDB.  
- **High-fidelity analytics**: Captures clickstreams, hint usage, timing, and completion data for research use.

## 🔬 Motivation & Research Design

Built to serve research investigating:

- **Key question**: How do activity types and autonomy features affect parent–child math involvement and child learning?
- **Design**: Randomized controlled study with counterbalanced activity order and structured difficulty progression.
- **Target group**: Elementary students (grades 3–5).  
- **Data collected**: Accuracy, response time, hints used, activity preference, session duration—using behavioral logs for subsequent quantitative analyses.
